I tried for like hours to vibe-code some shit together (since I don’t code), but nothing worked.
I tried to tell ChatGPT to translate the MIDI map from Virtual DJ to Mixxx, but that didn’t work.
Then I tried to use the CDJ2000 as a template, but that didn’t work either.
I gave up and watched a 13-year-old YouTube tutorial on how to do it (here is the vid btw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT8tZmwM00).
It had some errors, but a quick ChatGPT prompt fixed the issue.

Feel free to fix my project. I also realized I don’t need a jog wheel—it’s way too sensitive and reversed—so again, feel free to fix it.
